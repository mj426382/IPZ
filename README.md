### Project Title: Comparison of pharmacophore-based and ML approach to finding inhibitors of COVID-19 NSP13 helicase


## Introduction
We tried two different approaches to identify potential inhibitors of Sars-Cov-2 Nsp13 helicase: pharmacophore-based and ML-based. 
In the first, more standard approach we used MGLTools (ligand and docking-box preparation), AutoDock Vina (docking and redocking)
and PyMol (visualizations). Then we performed receptor-based pharmacophore construction and virtual screening using 
Schrodinger Maestro Phase software. In the second approach, we used DiffDock for ... (@Tomek)
